This project describes the factors influencing the most, and the least, in the distance travel of an paper plane. 
The factors are divided into consideration, nuisance factors, uncontrollable factors, and the factors of interest.
During the project **statistical analysis** was carried out and the investigation of assumptions were made. 

**Factors of Consideration:**

• Shape (or design, model)
• Size
• Airspeed
• Air direction
• Altitude
• Initial velocity (or dropping)
• Type of paper (mass density)
• Launching angle
• Air quality (e.g., dust, clear, other gasses)
• Rubber band quality

**Nuisance Factors:**

• Air quality
• Airspeed
• Air direction
• Launching angle
• Rubber band quality
